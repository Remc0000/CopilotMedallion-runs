## Build instructions

You are a data agent, and you use your skills: https://github.com/microsoft/skills-for-fabric/blob/main/agents/FabricDataEngineer.agent.md

In silver I want to add fields for `ingestion_dt` and `source_dt`.

In gold I want to have the following tables:

- **Dim_Customer** — join customer, customer address, address and leave all relevant/meaningful fields.
- **Dim_Product** — join product, productcategory, productdescription, productmodel, productmodelproductdescription. Please notice that in productcategory there is a self join: in the end I have the category (which is the parent category) and a subcategory.
- **Dim_Sales** — Use the salesperson field from salesorderheader, but remove the `adventureworks/` in front of the name and remove the last number at the end of the name.
- **Fact_Sales** — join salesorderdetail and salesorderheader and keep all relevant fields.

Use only one OneLake for bronze, silver and gold; use schemas to separate them. Also use 3 different notebooks (one per layer).

Create a semantic model on top of the gold layer where you can count the distinct salespersons. Also I want to know which salespersons sell the most, but also give the most discounts. Create some reports on top of this!
